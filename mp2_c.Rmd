## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

```{r}
##filter by year, MA, by DEM and REP
filtered_data <- candidates %>%
  filter ( cand_election_yr == 2012)%>%
  filter (cand_office_state == "MA")%>%
  filter (cand_party_affiliation %in% c("DEM", "REP"))
```

```{r}
##joing candidates and contributions data frame

joined_data <- filtered_data %>%
  inner_join(contributions, by = "cand_id")%>%
  filter(transaction_type %in% c("24A", "24E"))%>%
  filter (transaction_pgi %in% c ("G", "G2012"))
```

```{r}
##making two datasets for two parties
dem <- joined_data %>%
  filter (cand_party_affiliation == "DEM")
rep <- joined_data %>%
  filter (cand_party_affiliation == "REP")
```
